    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In this project, RAG is implemented using the Gemma library and a dataset of news articles in Japanese and English from various newspapers in Japan between 2001 and 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use RAG in This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Python Environment**:\n",
    "    Activate the Python environment by running the following command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    source {DH_INSTALLATION_PATH}/py312/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Main File**:\n",
    "    Execute the main file to start the application:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python main.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search for Articles**:\n",
    "    Enter keywords in Japanese or English to search for the most relevant articles. The system will use the RAG model to retrieve and generate the most contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clone the Repository**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/irsotarriva/DH.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Required Packages**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    If pip is installed as pip3, use:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Obtain Kaggle API Key**:\n",
    "    Follow the instructions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) to get your API key. This key is required to download the dataset and pre-trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Install Submodules**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git submodule update --init --recursive\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Install Gemma**:\n",
    "    Navigate to the Gemma repository and run:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install -e .\n",
    "    ```"
